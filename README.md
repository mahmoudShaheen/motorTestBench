# motorTestBench
Given any motor with unknown characteristics, 
the project aims to get and plot the characteristics of this motor 
with the help of a known motor that works as a reference.

The project uses Arduino and Matlab to get the characteristics of the motor 
using serial ports as a means of communication.
