# motorTestBench

Given any motor with unknown characteristics, the project aims to get and plot the characteristics of this motor with the help of a known (or even unknown) motor that works as a reference.

The project uses Arduino and Matlab to get the characteristics of the motor using serial ports as a means of communication.

Characteristics we aim to identify are current running in motor (in Amps), Voltage applied on the Motor (in Volts) and the RMP of the motor.

Of course these Characteristics are measured for both motors.
